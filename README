NAME
    Unix::SavedIDs - interface to unix saved id commands: getresuid(),
    getresgid(), setresuid() and setresgid()

SYNOPSIS
        use Unix::SavedIDs;

            my($ruid,$euid,$suid) = getresuid();
            setresuid(10,10,10);

STATUS
    This is alpha code. I'm going to be using it a lot in production and
    once I'm comfortable that it's working well I'll up the version number
    to 1.0 and call it a production release.

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a simple interface to the c routines with the same names.

    $<, $>, $(, $) and the POSIX setuid(),seteuid etc... functions give you
    access to the real uid/gid (ruid/rgid) and effective uid/gid
    (*euid*/*egid*), but there was no way to get or set the saved uid/gid
    (*suid*/*sgid*).

INTERFACE
  getresuid()

    returns a list of 3 elements, the current *ruid*, *euid* and *suid* or
    croaks on failure.

  getresgid()

    returns a list of 3 elements, the current *rgid*, *egid* and *sgid* or
    croaks on failure.

  setresuid(*ruid*,*euid*,*suid*)

    Sets the current *ruid*, *euid* and *suid* or croaks on failure.

    If you pass fewer than three args, the values corresponding to
    unspecified args will not be changed. E.G. if you call
    `setresuid(10,20)', you will change the *ruid* and *euid* but the *suid*
    will not change. If this is what you want, you're probably better off
    using $<,$> etc... setresgid behaves in the same way.

  setresgid(*rgid*,*egid*,*sgid*)

    Sets the current *rgid*, *egid* and *sgid* or croaks on failure.

    Please see setresuid() above for information on what happens when you
    specify fewer than 3 args.

TODO
    1   make more complete test suite

    2   make build system detect if saved ids are supported and do something
        clever if not

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    I recently discovered Proc::UID by Paul Fenwick. It does everything that
    this module does plus more. Sadly, its unmaintained since 2004 and the
    author specifically states that it is not for production code.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    It should do someting rational on systems without saved ids.

    I only have Linux and OpenBSD systems to test on, so I have no idea how
    it might work on other operating systems. If you run a different OS,
    please let me know how this module works in your environment.

    Please report any bugs or feature requests to
    `bug-unix-savedids@rt.cpan.org', or through the web interface at
    http://rt.cpan.org.
