=head1 NAME

B<Unix::SetUser> - carefully drop root privileges 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Unix::SetUser;

	if ( $> != 0 ) {
		die "Run this as root!\n";
	}
	
	# do something with root privileges

	set_user('nobody');

	# do stuff without root privileges

  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

Dropping privileges is something that needs to be done right and can 
easily be done wrong.  Even if you know how to do it right, it takes a 
lot of boring code.  

=head1 About Saved IDs

Most modern unices have saved ids.  This is a 3rd id type, so you have real
user id, effective user id and now saved user id.  (The same applies to groups).
This means if you don't set your saved id, you really haven't dropped root
privileges.  Please see L<Unix::SavedIDs>, the module used in Unix::SetUser to
handle saved ids, for more information.

=head1 USAGE

=head2 set_user(I<new_user>, [I<primary_group>] , [I<supplemental_group> ... ]);

This is the only function provided by B<Unix::SetUser>.  It is exported by 
default.  

B<set_user()> switches the uid, euid, suid, gid, egid, sgid and reduces the supplemental groups to those specified if any.

I<new_user> is the user name or numeric user id of the user whom 
you wish the process to run as.

I<primary_group> is the group name or numeric group id of the primary group.
If undefined, the primary group of the user I<new_user> is used.

I<supplemental_group> is any group which you'd like the process to be a member of.  If undefined, all supplemental group memberships are dropped.

All names and groups are assumed to be numeric uids and numeric gids if 
they are integers.  Otherwise they are assumed to be user names or group names.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 4

=item *

set_user('jdoe');

Switch the uid, euid & suid to 'jdoe'.
Switch the gid, egid & suid to jdoe's primary group (probably 'jdoe' 
or 'users' but maybe not.)
Drop membership in any other groups.

=item * 

set_user('jdoe','users,'tape');

Switch the uid, euid & suid to 'jdoe'.
Switch the gid, egid & sgid to 'users'. 
Add membership in the 'tape' group and drop membership in any other groups.

=item * 

set_user('jdoe',undef,'tape');

Switch the uid, euid & suid to 'jdoe'.
Switch the gid, egid & sgid to jdoe's primary group (probably 'jdoe' 
or 'users' but maybe not.)
Add membership in the 'tape' group and drop membership in any other groups.

=back

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

B<set_user()> returns undef on success and croaks on failure.

=head1 DISCUSSION

Here's some of the gotchas involved in dropping privileges.  
These are all taken care of by Unix::SetUser

=over 4

=item Make sure you drop group membership as well as changing user id.

=item Handle supplemental groups as well as the users primary group.

=item Set saved ids as well as real and effective ids.

=item Check to make sure ids really did change.

=item Check group membership without getting hung up about the order 
the groups are listed in.

=back

=head1 PORTABILITY

This module will only work on unix-like systems which support saved ids.  That
is the vast majority of unices.  I would like to add support for unices without
saved ids and Windows, but I don't use those systems so I can't justify the
time spent.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

After I wrote version 0.1, I discovered L<Proc::UID> by Paul Fenwick.  It does
everything that this module does plus more.  Sadly, its unmaintained since 2004
and the author specifically states that it is not for production code.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

This has only been tested on Linux and OpenBSD.

I assume you want uid == euid == suid and gid == euid == suid.  If you don't 
L<Unix::SavedIds> will let you manipulate all 3.

C<bug-process-dropprivs@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
